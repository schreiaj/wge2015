##Ideal screen-reader user interaction
* Have it start reading the content where it makes the most sense for the application (not necessarily from the top left corner) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Make it clear to the user that the page content has changed <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
